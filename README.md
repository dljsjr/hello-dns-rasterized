# hello-dns-rasterized

Static HTML version of [PowerDNS's `hello-dns`](https://powerdns.org/hello-dns/). The original site uses [markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/), which converts MD to HTML in the browser via JS, which could be undesirable for a variety of reasons.

These HTML files are created by using [markdeep-rasterizer](https://github.com/romainguy/markdeep-rasterizer) and some manual text replacement to clean up some `href`'s.

The content is otherwise unchanged; this is simply a place to have a JS-free browsing experience for these docs, with no intent to modify or change the content in any other way.

## TODO

Automate the text transformations.
